🌍 DevOps — Terraform

🧩 Overview

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp.
It allows you to define, provision, and manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, and GCP) using a declarative configuration language (HCL).

⚙️ Why Use Terraform?

🚀 Automation: Manage your infrastructure as code — fully automated deployments.

🌐 Multi-Cloud Support: Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, and many others.

🔁 Consistency: Reproducible environments across teams and environments.

💡 Scalability: Manage complex infrastructure with ease.

🧠 Version Control: Store and track infrastructure changes using Git.
