🧩 Overview

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that helps teams track changes, collaborate, and manage code efficiently.

⚙️ Why Git?

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaboration: Work together without overwriting code.

🔁 Version History: Track every change.

🕒 Rollback: Easily revert to previous versions.

🧱 Branching & Merging: Isolate and combine features seamlessly.

🌍 Open Source & Universal: Works with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.
